			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p><h4>So, whats this all about?</h4><br> This is my little pet project, I intend to create a fully-functional website that supports <br>
			Java and SQL to provide a more interactive experience.<br><br> For all intents and purposes this site is just a diving board into the ocean that is 
			website creation and management.<br> 
			<br>I'm going to try and maintain a blog, It will include update logs and dates.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>2/13/2018</h3>
			<p>I briefly experimented with adding links to social media pages, CSS can be a real pain sometimes and I couldn't manage to get the <br> button quite where I wanted. It's probably because I used ID assigns instead of classes, at the time I didn't realize how much headache<br> that would create.
			Oh well, just need to rewrite everything...</p><br>
			<h3>2/8/2018</h3>
			<p>I decided to relearn HTML and CSS and create my own, fully-functional, website.<br> Here, I will be keeping a blog of my thoughts and ideas as well as things I've implemented (or will shortly). Hopefully I keep this up!</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="implement">	
			<h3>This is where I'll be keeping updates and notes</h3>
			<p>(Or at least until I decide to give it it's own page...)</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>2/13/2018 -- </strong>Experimented with linking social media sites and fixing the footer.</p>
			<p><strong>2/8/2018 -- </strong> Made the Navigation look a little nicer and turned it into a bar instead of that ugly, wikpedia style mess that it was.<br>
			Will probably redo a lot of the old pages and make things prettier... hopefully...</p>
			<p><strong>2/7/2018 -- </strong> Created the website and started working on adding pages and getting links set up.</p>
