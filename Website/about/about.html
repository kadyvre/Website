			<h2>How Long Have I Been Doing This?</h2>
			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">I started programming with python in 2015... or maybe it was 2014... Well, whenever it was, thats what I started with.<br>
			I learned C# after that, both of those languages I learned at Lansing Community College. HTML and CSS however,<br> I learned in 2016 at Northwestern Michigan College.
			I'm pretty rusty with HTML and CSS though due to not using<br> it since those two classes, Hopefully I can use this website to brush up on them.<br><br>
			And now that I think about it, I actually started learning to program with Javascript in 2010</p>

			<h2>What Do I Hope to Accomplish?</h2>
			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with this website once it's functional.<br>
			Quite a few idea's have crossed my mind, opening up a public forum has been an interest of mine for some time.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 25px;">I am definitely going to try and implement SQL and Javascript into my website to make it more modern,<br>
			right now it looks like it was made in 2005...</p>
