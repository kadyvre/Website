			<h2 style="text-align: center;">You may be wondering what some (or all) of that stuff I mentioned adding in does</h2>
			<br><br><br><br>
			<h3>CSS</h3>
			<p>Firstly, CSS or "Cascading Style Sheets". CSS is what makes a page look the way it does;<br>
			Instead of just being a bunch of random floating text, it now has decoration.</p>
			
			<h3>Clickable Links</h3>
			<p>You should probably already know what this one does seeing as you've gotten this far...</p>
			
			<h3>Javascript</h3>
			<p>The fun one, it gives a webpage functionality, from the simple stuff like spinning icons to clickable buttons <br> 
			and simple animations</p>
			
			<h3>SQL</h3>
			<p>SQL stands for "Structured Query Language". This programming language stores and retrieves data from a server source,<br>
			 It makes it possible to create accounts and store data on a website. Extremely useful for any kind of functioning website.</p>
